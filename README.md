  <h1>AVD Launcher</h1>
</div>

- A lightning-fast, ultra-lightweight native app for launching Android Virtual Devices.  
- Cross-platform, portable, and minimal.
<br/><br/>

## üì• Downloads
Grab the latest version for your platform from the [**Releases page**](https://github.com/symonxdd/AVD-Launcher/releases/latest).

> ‚ÑπÔ∏è GitHub 'Releases' is GitHub jargon for downloads.

No install required ‚Äî just download and run!
<br/><br/>

## üí° Motivation
I'm always excited to try out new technologies, and this project was a perfect opportunity to dive into something fresh. This is my first time working with **Go** and **Wails**.

As someone who occasionally develops for mobile, I've always found myself needing a simple tool to quickly launch Android Virtual Devices (AVDs) without the overhead of opening Android Studio. This need became even more apparent during my college internship, where I spent a lot of time working with AVDs but was frustrated by the process of launching Android Studio just to start an emulator. That‚Äôs when the idea for **AVD Launcher** came to life.

Wails provides a fantastic bridge between the frontend (Vue.js) and Go‚Äôs powerful backend, and I loved how easy it was to get started. There were challenges along the way, but each hurdle made the project that much more rewarding. The integration of both languages felt natural, and I quickly found myself enjoying the process.

> **Note on `app/helper/command_*.go`**  
> These two files are **OS-specific** and use [Go build tags](https://pkg.go.dev/go/build#hdr-Build_Constraints) to automatically select the correct one during build time. This ensures clean handling of platform quirks without any runtime checks.

<br/>

## üîß Dev Prerequisites
To build or run in live dev mode, follow the [official Wails installation guide](https://wails.io/docs/gettingstarted/installation).  
You'll need Go installed, along with Node and a package manager like `npm`, `yarn`, or `pnpm`.
<br/><br/>

## ‚öôÔ∏è Live Development
To start the app in live development mode:
```bash
wails dev
```
This runs a Vite-powered dev server with hot reload for the frontend.
<br/><br/>

## üì¶ Release Build
To generate a production-ready, standalone binary:
```bash
wails build
```
This compiles the app and outputs a native executable, ready to distribute.
<br/><br/>

## üöÄ Release Workflow

AVD Launcher uses a fully automated release pipeline powered by **GitHub Actions** and a helper script.

To create a new release, run the release script:
```bash
npm run release
```

This will:

1. Prompt to select the version type (`Patch`, `Minor`, or `Major`)
2. Bump the version in `frontend/package.json`
3. Commit the version bump and create a Git tag
4. Push the commit and tag to GitHub

> ‚ÑπÔ∏è The version bump uses a conventional commit message like:  
> `chore: bumped version to v1.2.3`

When a `v*` tag is pushed, the [`release.yml`](.github/workflows/release.yml) GitHub Actions workflow is triggered.

- üîß Builds native binaries for:
  - Linux (amd64)
  - Windows (.exe)
  - macOS (.pkg)
- üóÉ Renames and organizes the build artifacts.
- üìù Creates a new GitHub Release and uploads the binaries with OS-specific labels.

üí° The release process can be viewed under the repo's **Actions** tab

> üß† _Note: This release pipeline wasn't built overnight ‚Äî it took a full day of trial, error, and frustration to get it working just right. If you're struggling to set up something similar, you're not alone!_
